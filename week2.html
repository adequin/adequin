								<h1>Week 2: Vinyl and Laser Cutting</h1>
							<p>Documentation outline<br>
							- What is my goal<br>
								- get a box to house electronics<br>
								- slice a geometry<br>
								- make a looks like model<br>
							- sketch<br>
								-image<br>
							- download fusion<br>
								- update mac<br>
								- clear 30Gb of storage<br>
								- wait 3h in limbo<br>
								- get through a bunch of pop ups<br>
							- create box<br>
							- lose patience and go to a finger box generator<br>
							- learn how to manipulate parameters<br>
							- take measurements to reference<br>
							- create constrained parametric geometry for each piece<br>
							- create brackets to model the layout and figure out the clearances<br>
							- export as svg<br>
							- add 2d engraving for fun<br>
							- TO DO use fusion slicer to make sliced sphere<br><br>

							- cutting<br>
								- test cut for kerf<br>
								- test design on carboard<br>
								- make looks-like using acrylic<br>
								- acrylic glue for the finger joint box?

							</p>
								
							<h1>Making prototypes that I can rapidly test with.</h1>
							<p> Ok. The first attempt was a little cluttered, I would like to generate the box more cleanly and 
								add an engraving and some evenly spaced holes.
								Ill start by sketching a square on the xy plane. for time I simply decided to insert the dxf of the fingbox design I used and add on the engraving pattern that I made previously.

								While trying to drag around the color ordering, I used control alt click and it closed the software with no warning. Luckily it saved a backup.
								It looks like the engraving goes before any vector cuts by default, regardless of color arrangement.<br>

								oops, looks like the cutting bed was different than the actual bed for some reason. It looks like I actually ignored a warning that the print settings raised.
								Instead of fixing the problem of the bed, I simply shift it over by some margin in corel draw and click print preview to verify.
								All good now! I repeat the 2 sides that didn't make it on the first cut and cut out panels for 2 more boxes. This should be enough for more prototyping.<br>

								And that's it for now! I have a looks like model and some more boxes that I can put holes and to arrange my screws and stick things to.<br>

								<h2>Deriving parameters</h2>
								I would like to clean up the drawing for my own satisfaction. 
								The first step is to somehow import all the parameters from my previous drawing. 
								There is a derive feature, but it looks like I can't use it for a seperate document, I'll just screenshot and do it by hand this time.
								<!-- <deriv image> -->
								Nevermind I got it to work! Although it looks like the parameters are linked to the original document which makes me uncomfortable.
								<!-- <favorite image> -->
								Maybe I can get around this by favoriting the parameters.
								<!-- <deleting paraemtric box image> -->
								maybe not. Instead, I copied them by referencing the derived parameters, just in case. I found the derive feature in the timeline of the new document and deleted it.
								<!-- <deleting derive feature> -->
								Now the parameters are not linked.

								Now, I'll start by creating a component and sketching a square. Next, remove the holes for the finger joints. I'll make a square that I dimension (shortcut d) using my thickness and fingerlength parameters.
								Then, using the rectangular pattern in one direction I can create a row of joints that I control with an integer parameter for the number of fingers, in the other
								I'll make 2 copies so that I get a second row along the bottom edge. 
								<!-- <image of rectangular pattern> -->
								<!-- <checking rectangular pattern works> -->
								Create a mirror copy along the diagonal so that everything is symmetric. Do this by creating a construction line along the diagonal and using the mirror function.
								<!-- <construction line>
								<mirror> -->
								I suspect theres a better way to do this, but I don't know it.
								After extruding it by the thickness parameter, I got the base in a slightly less cluttered way!
