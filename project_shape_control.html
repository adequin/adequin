							<h1>Project Closed Loop Shape Control</h1>
							<p>
							This is my UROP research project for IAP 2023.
							The goal is to explore sensing deformations in a plate-like structure to construct a digital twin. 
							Additionally, we aim to have the structure be closely integrated with the sensing components and pcb 
							and to eventually actuate and control the shape directly.
							The first step is to see if we can use resistors as cheap sensors.
							</p>
							
							<h3 style="text-align:left">WEEK 1 Jan 8-12</h3>
							<p>
							As a first step, I will be learning strain sensing circuits and implementing them on a breadboard
							using a xiao samd21. </p>
							
							<p>
							This first test is to use a strain gauge (25k ohms unstrained) as a resistor in a voltage divider configuration and to measure the change in voltage
							at the output node. <br></p>
							
							<p></p>
							To setup the xiao samd21 I found the arduino core url from within <a href="https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2023/03/12/xiao-samd21-arduino-and-midi/">this documentation </a>
							To install Arduino>Settings> Additional Board Manager URLs:https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json<br>
							And then in Tools>Board>Boards Manager find Seeed SAMD Boards and install. I made the mistake of removing the json file for the esp32 cores which take forever to download. Apparently you can just have multiple urls seperated by commas. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Before I run anything, I need to have the circuit ready. Since my usbc cable is pulling the arduino for the header pins I'm going to solder them. Soldering these was very satisifying. Then to complete the voltage divider, I use a 10k resistor connected to ground
							while the strain gauge is connected to the 3.3V output of the xiao. According to the voltage divider formula the voltage should be Vin*R2/(R1+R2) = 3.3*10k/26k = 1.27V 
							From initial tests it looks like the readings are fairly unreliable since they change when I touch parts of the board or the amount of pressure on the breadboard, but 
							it doesn't actually measure a change when going from ground to 3.3V. The change to 5V is pretty noticeable and the strain gauge seemed to show some change in the reading when bending it, but I can't be sure that it isn't just from the pressure on the gauge or contact with my hand.
							</p>
							<p>
							It looks like using "A7" for the D7 pin compiled but was not actually being used and the readings were just stray voltage. I confirmed this by switching to the A0 pin and reading ground and 3.3V values and it changed from ~0 to ~1023.
							I'm not sure why A7 doesn't work since it was referenced <a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/">here</a>, but I will just use A0 for now.
						</p>
						<p></p>
							With a 10k resistor the analogRead values ranged from 100/1023 when bending backwards 180degrees to 250/1023 when left unstrained to 325/1023 when bent forward; a range of about 225<br>
							With a 20k resistor the analogRead values are 185, 415, and, 490, a range of about 300.
							With a 30k resistor the analogRead values are 200, 510, and, 600, a range of about 400.
							With a 40k resistor the analogRead values are 240, 580, and, 670, a range of about 430.
							With a 50k resistor the analogRead values are 290, 630, and, 720, a range of about 430.
							Using a multimeter it looks like the gauge is actually 30k ohms when flat, 20k when bent forward and 100k when bent backwards.
						</p>
						<p>
							Wheatstone Bridge for strain gauges 
							After <a href="https://www.omega.com/en-us/resources/wheatstone-bridge">reading </a>a bit, wheatstone bridges sense a relative voltage, making the circuit less susceptible to noise, and letting 0V be the balance point.
							The wheatstone bridge is really just the voltage divider with another voltage divider in parallel as a reference. 
						</p>
					<p>
							For some reason the pin next to A0 is A10 and not A1 like in the documentaion. also D3->A8
							Using A0 and A8 for the wheatstone bridge, I end up with this configuration. <insert image>
							I'm also reading the values using  <a href="strain_test/strain_test.ino">this code</a>
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left">WEEK 2 Jan 16-19</h3>
					<p>
							Next, I'll move on to testing on a pcb board using some resistors instead of strain gauges
							<circuit image>
							Here is the initial test. This should let me reuse the same xiao breakout board to test different setups.
							The first test is to see if the resistors react differently in tension vs compression and to see if I can maybe
							read the values without an amplifier.
						</p>
					<p>
							To mill the board I'll be figuring out how to use V-bits.
							Just by using the v-bit calculator in https://modsproject.org/ instead of the 1/64 module things worked out fine.
							I also soldered everything and added a few connectors.</p>
							<soldered board with connector>
							<p>
							Now back to arduino code. Here is what I got when printing the variables A0-A9: <br>
							
							<pre><code>
19:00:16.809 -> HELLO
19:00:16.809 -> 14
19:00:16.809 -> 15
19:00:16.809 -> 16

19:00:16.809 -> 23
						</code>
						</pre>
						</p>
					<p>
							Since I used a pin that doesn't have a name, I simply used a jumper to a different pin. With this setup, I tested to see
							if there was a noticeable difference in the analog read output. There was not. Based on Miana's feedback, I tested to see if the resistance changed 
							using a multimeter when bending. There was a variation of about 1 ohm. 

							As the next step, I made an amplifier circuit that would
							amplify the difference between the nodes of a wheatstone bridge.</p>

							<circuit design>
							<pcb eagle >
							<soldered>
							<p>
							While the nodes of the wheatstone bridge should have the same reading since they use the same resistor values, when connected to the differential amplifier
							the reading of one of the nodes is 2.1V instead of 2.6V. Since the amplification is of about 820x, 0.5V differnet quickly gets amplified beyond the cap of 5V.
							Maybe I'll try a lower value than 800k to see if that changes anything. I tried 499k and it didn't change anything. One thing I noticed is that 
							when measuring ohmic resistance of some of the 1k resistors, some of them had 664 ohm resistance instead of 1k. Looking at the skematic it looks like 
							that resistor is in parallel with 2 1k resistors in series which give it an equivalent resistance of 666 ohms. Since this is due to the grounds being connected, 
							I'm not sure if this contributed to the issue. Thats all for this week</p>
							
							
							<h3 style="text-align:left">WEEK 3 Jan 22-26</h3>
							<simulation>
							<p>
							After trying to formulate my problem to ask for help I realized that I can try simulating it. In this simulation, its clear that the different values was not a mechanical 
							or noise issue but just the circuit was wrong. by drawing it up like this it was clear that the ground connections changed the resistance in the wheatsone bridge and no longer made it balanced. 
						</p>
					<p>
							To fix this issue I thought of different solutions. Maybe it would be possible to add the same impedance to the other leg of the wheatstone bridge, or to read the output of the bridge 
							and use a microcontroller to replicate the signal into the differential amplifier circuit. I good suggestion from GPT was to use a unity gain buffer. I never really understood what they were for 
							but now that I'm in this situation it makes a lot of sense. I redesigned the circuit in eagle with 2 unity gain buffers at the outputs of the wheatstone bridge to isolate them.
						</p>
							<edesign>
							<new pcb>
							<p>
							Upon further recommendation from gpt, I added capacitors before all the op amps to clean up the signal potentially, using 0.1 microF ceramic bypassing capacitors in parallel 
							to filter out any ac noise that might occur, as well as a 10microF capacitor at the pcb power inputs for good measure. Since this was a very enlightening use of capacitors I took some time to read about typical usages and values and positioned 
							them in my design accordingly. It looks like decoupling and bypassing have similar implementation but decoupling is a term used for smoothing out low frequency noise from dc
							while bypassing is used when filter high frequency noise from a dc signal.</p>
							</p>
							<edesign>
							<new pcb>
							<milled board>
							<p>
							After some inital tests its clear that there are still issues. After spending some time simulating in circuit lab, talking to gpt and reading datasheets, (and debugging my simulations)
							it looks like the main issues are that I didn't account for the CMRR, common mode rejection ratio, and that my forumla for the diff amp was wrong. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The CMRR is a ratio in decibells that follow this formula: 20log(gain_cm/gain_diff) with common values of 70-80 db. Higher value means better rejection
							Since this ratio scales with the gain factor of my setup, maybe I can minimize the common mode voltage gain by maximizing the gain of the diff amp circuit.
						</p>
							<graph>
							<p>
							Reading the datasheet of the ad8605 it looks like the gain for dc cm voltage is 90db. using the formula I found that at 800 A_diff (A for gain), A_cm becomes 0.0253 and at 500, A_cm becomes 0.016.
							So the scaling is actually directly affected by the differential voltage gain, so maximizing the gain would actually increase the cm gain, my previous statement is wrong.
							</p>
							<p>
							In my notes I only set 1 resistor to set the gain when I need to set 2 of them, there should be 2 pairs of resistor values. Now that I fixed this in the simulations it looks like things
							are working as expected. I just need to switch out some resistor values and my setup should work.
							</p>
							<p>
							Final fix (hopefully), since I'm using 5V and ground for VCC, I need to swap the values of vin- and vin+ in the diff amp circuit since the voltage at the leg of the wheatstone brige decrease when the resistor is strained, thus it needs
							to go to the inverting input so that the total stays positive.
							</p>
							<p>
							Ok I made a mistake and just swapped the inputs to the op amp, but that wouldn't work since the feedback would be going into the non inverting input which is illegal.
							So I swapped the inputs before the resistors by adding a couple jumpers and doing some surgery. It looks terrible, but it works!
							</p>

							<p>
							Now that I can measure the signal of the deformation I have a few objectives to think about:
							<ul>
								<li>Determining direction</li>
								<li>Scaling Efficiently</li>
								<li>Interpret Reading as Strain Measurement</li>
								<li>Creating a model with the data</li>
							</ul>

							I'll start by thinking about these seperately and seeing whats possible. For determining the direction, Alfonso showed me a useful 
							circuit, the full bridge version of the wheatstone bridge where all the resistors are used as sensors. While I havent read into this, 
							I'm not sure if this is possible with resistors that can't tell which direction they are being bent in, although it does look like that 
							bending in one direction yields a higher change in resistance than bending in the other direction (at least when on a pcb). 

							I need to verify if the resistors do actually act differently depending on orientation and what the actual range of value is. I broke the board at around 0.6V reading. 
							Definitely not near the 4ohm difference from Miana's test. 

							Ok after some tests using the ohmeter and bending resistors with pliers, it looks like the resistance increases when the bending is concave and increases when the bending is convex (~4ohms max for both). (black side up)
							It is still interesting to verify the readings from bending resistors on the pcb since it might have different compression/tension strain due to the solder holding it in place.

							For the next boards I'll make a board that is simply the diff amplifier with the buffers and other boards to test different bridge configurations. 


						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align:left">WEEK 4 Jan 29-Feb 2</h3>

						<p>
							This is the last week for this project. As the first step, I made the isolated diff amp circuit and a new sensing board that is a half wheatstone bridge
							configuration instead of the quarter version from before. The difference is that I am straining two resistors, from opposite sides of the wheatstone bridge diamond, 
							which doubles the signal. One thing I didn't expect is how well the direction of bending is captured. I think I need to isolate the VCC- for the op amp to capture both bending directions.
						</p>

						<p>
							Once I isolated the negative VCC input to the differential amplifier, I realized I could just flip the inputs for now.
							For the next step, I made a board to be tested with a 3 point bending setup. To minimize the bending of the reference resistors, I used an L shaped board and put them 
							on the shorter leg. Something weird happened with the milling process. While the depth of cut was correct in the G code and I thought I zeroed everything properly, it cut much deeper than usual and broke the bit. 
							I suspect that since the gcode file has an origin that is a pretty far, I zeroed it at a much different height then the cutting region. I since learned that by right clicking in the simulation you can set 
							the work offset so that where ever the endmill is corresponds to where you want it to be in the simulation (although the zeros might get messed up once the job is done if its too far from the bed).
						</p>

						<p>
							For the instron testing, I plan to synchronize the instron measurements with the data from the xiao samd21 analog read. It looks like that with the longer test board, there is a lot more noise in the signal, so the votage difference actually starts at 1.2V and goes to 4.7 when strained.
							Since the ref voltage of the xiao I am using is 3.3V, I'll use 3.3V instead of 5V to power the circuit, which should scale everything down into the operating range.
