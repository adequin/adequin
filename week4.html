						<h2>goals for the week</h2>
						<p>
							1. 3D scan an origami piece<br>
							2. 3D print tiny linked polyhedra<br>
							3. CAD my prototype parametrically<br>
							4. 3D print and test housing for components<br>
							</p>
							

						<h2>Part 1: 3D scan an origami piece</h2>

						The quick training at the lab shows a very straightforward process for 3D scanning:<br>
						1. place part on a flat surface with black guide lines (take extra precaution if black or reflective)<br>
						2. take out the scanner, turn it on, and create a new project<br>
						3. press start and walk around the object while keeping in range (the object should be highlighted in green, not red)<br>
						4. save the project to SD<br>
						5. open it on a computer with artec studio (the processing software for the scanner)<br>
						6. right click the object in the hierarchy and click show<br>
						7. check for damaged frames and delete them<br>
						8. click autopilot and follow the directions<br>
						9. export to stl or wlt with png texture for printing on the Strataysis<br>
						<br>

						For my scan I want to scan this black flying turtle I designed 2 years ago:<br>

						Following the steps: <br>
						My setup:<br>

						<span class="image">

						</span><br>
						Its better than I was expecting! especially for a black flat surfaced object, although a lot of the crisp folds
						were smoothed out. <br><br>


						<h2>Part 2: 3D print tiny linked polyhedra</h2>
						This is a projected that I started just before the semester. Since I didnt get into the class last year, I
						started this in case I did get in. This project has a few parts:<br>
						- Finding which polyhedra to use and how to construct them<br>
						- Designing the polyhedra in CAD<br>
						- Printing and processing<br>
						- Iterating to find good tolerances<br>
						<br>

						For the types of polyhedra, I already had the icosahedron in mind. I knew that I wanted to learn sls printing and that printing an 
						small scale icosahedron frame would work better with having to risk removing supports. To expand on the icosahedron, I also modeled and printed
						the other platonic solids: tetrahedron, dedecahedron, octohedron, and some variation of a cube. 
						<br>
						Additionally, I wanted to experiment with filling in the interior verticies using a script in grasshopper so that it would definitely
						not be easy to do subtractively. For that part of the assignement I ended up creating an icosahedron that could wiggle around in a dodecahedron, as well
						as the interior icosahedron of a cube that has all of its verticies connected (as well as the mid points):
						
						<br>

						</span><br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/SLS_polyhedra/octohedron.jpeg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br>

						To model the icosahedron, the wiki page had a helpful reference that it can be constructed using intersecting golden ratio rectangles. I then wrote a script that takes 
						in points and returns all of the interior connecting lines. If I only want the exterior lines I can check that each line width is the expected size. 
							To create the dodecahedrons, I wrote a script that creates the surfaces of the icosahedron so that I can find the centroids using grasshopper's area component, 
							and finally run my script to generate the frame.

						</span><br>
						After some experimenting with shapes and intersections, and reorienting to be level with the bed, I had these geometries:<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/grasshopper_polyhedra/finalPrintRender.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br>
						After slicing in formlabs slicer:<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/grasshopper_polyhedra/FinalPrintSetup.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br>
						Since the actual printing process was in a bit messy and required masks, gloves, etc. I didnt actually record much of it.
						Once the parts were printed and excavated, I had to clean out the remaining powder in a sandblaster:<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/SLS_polyhedra/SandBlasting.jpeg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br>
						Once that was done (after an hour of handling tiny parts through thick gloves), I was left with these parts:<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/SLS_polyhedra/Processed.jpeg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br>
						After repeating this process a first time to find what the tolerances where for the smallest print possible: (about .8mm linkage diameter)
						I decided to make earrings out of them as a gift(this was also the plan all along):<br>

						<h2>Part 3: Cading the prototype </h2>
						Step 1: Measuring all the parameters</h2>
						These are all the parts that I've been using for my prototype:</h2>
						<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="finalproject/allParts.jpeg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						I started by measuring all of the dimensions and storing them as parameters in Fusion (with very apt names)</h2>
						<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/parameters.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>

						Since this CAD process to a lot of trial and error, and finally getting around to following very helpful tutorials 
						(like this series recommended by Alfonso https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A)</h2>
						I will try to keep it straightforward. Here is the overall process:<br>
						<br>
						First, I create the component of the frame of my cube. <br>
						Then, create the brackets by extruding rectangles and mirroring along the diagonal plane.<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/CreateBracket.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Make the holes using rectangular array and calculating the distances from the edges. <br>
						I used something like ratio*(cube_side-2*(outer_thickness+inner_thickness)), with the ratio as 1/4 or 1/3.<br>

						Assemble the brackets with the holes by snapping them.<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/AssembleBrackets.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Create the coils: Create a cylinder and add a tight coil around it with the coil radius and height parameters.<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/AssembleCoil.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Adding some materials<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/AssignMaterials.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Create the screw by extruding circles<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/CreateScrew.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Import the cube design and place on a face of the frame.<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/LaputDesign.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						Some of the things I had to debug were: .<br>
						- figuring out how to keep things organzied and compatible with assembly (this is explained very well in the tutorial series).<br>
						- finding the right plane for mirroring the brackets (I extruded triangles drawn on the side planes and used those).<br>
						- how to move components relative to each other (create joints).<br>
						- constraining holes to the middle of a rectangle (create construction lines).<br>
						- missalignment, I found a mistake while trying to change a parameter. <br>
						It turns out one of the dimension was an aribtrary number instead of a paramenter :/<br><br>
						<span class="image">

						</span><br>
						<span class="image">

							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						
						The final assembly with all the materials is very satifying.
						I was very impress at how straigthforward things were after figuring out the mechanics.<br><br>
						<span class="image">

						</span><br>
						Here is the final design for now:<br>
						<span class="image">
							<img src="Week4/HousingModeling/CurrentModel.jpg" alt="" width="400" 
							height="auto"/>
						</span><br><br>
						In the future here are the features I will add:<br>
						- sliding feature for joining with the second half of the frame<br>
						- battery holder<br>
						- magnet holders in the wall for the opposing side of the coils<br>
						- locking mechanism once the second half slides all the way download<br>
						- rp2040 placeholder<br>
